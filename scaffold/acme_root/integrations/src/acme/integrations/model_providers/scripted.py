"""The scripted provider: the twin of every model provider. It answers each
call with the next turn of its script, streamed in parts and ending in the
reply with its usage, or fails with the turn's error kind, before the
stream or after part of it. So every suite runs offline and the same way
twice, and a session's recorded replies can drive it again.

It stands in for one provider at a time, by name, and is refused at boot
in a deployed environment, like every twin."""
