"""The one content shape: a provider-neutral block model that runs through
the engine and across the provider boundary. A step's content is made of
these blocks (`acme.om.steps.types.content`), and each provider adapter
translates them both ways. They live here, beneath the object model,
because the object model imports the integrations and never the reverse
(ADR 1005).

A block is one of text, image, document, thinking, tool use, and tool
result, told apart by its `kind`. An adapter builds blocks from what a
model returns, so every block is validated as it is built: a block of an
unknown kind, a field of the wrong type, or a field no block has is
refused there, and nothing past it reads a loose dictionary. An image or a
document is a reference to an attachment, never its bytes.

Every string a block holds is one both storage impls keep as it is
(`Stored`): a NUL, which Postgres refuses in text and in JSON, and a lone
surrogate, which no UTF-8 encodes, each become U+FFFD when the block is
built, so a step the memory impl keeps is the step Postgres keeps, and
neither append fails on what a model wrote."""
