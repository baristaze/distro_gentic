"""The agents swimlane: agent kinds, the trees sessions form, and the work
one kind hands another. One loop serves every kind; a kind is a profile
over it, and a sub-agent is a session with a parent, spawned through a
`spawn`-class tool so it is gated and audited like any other power.

A child starts from a self-contained objective, never its parent's
history. It holds no more than its parent: its tools are cut to its
parent's, its calls run under its parent's principal, it pays as its
parent pays, it carries its parent's mark, and it draws on its tree's
budget and deadline. Cancelling a parent cancels its children."""
