"""Who stands behind a step. Three answers, each its own field: the actor
that produced it (on the step), the principal on whose authority it runs
(on an input and a tool call), and the spender who pays (on a model
request).

A principal is a user of the tenant: a person speaking for themselves or
through a program, or a service principal the tenant grants. An agent is
never one. Its steps name it as their actor, with its kind and its session
(`AgentRef`), so an audit answers "which agent" without the agent holding
a permission of its own."""
