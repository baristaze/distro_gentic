"""The attribution swimlane: who stands behind each step of a session, who
pays for its next model call, whose authority its next tool call runs
under, and whether a convinced model needs a person before it acts
outward.

It keeps one record per session, its authority: the mode, the principal,
and the spender a spawn passed it. The rest is read off the session (the
speaker and the mark it caches with its status) and the steps after that
cache, so an answer is never older than the history. A session with no
authority runs no tool call and spends nothing."""
