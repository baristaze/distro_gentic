"""Pure rules of attribution: which input a principal wrote, which content
instructs and which is data, who pays for the next model call, whose
authority a tool call runs under, and when a convinced model needs a
person. Values in, values out; no clock, no storage.

A model request records its speaker: the principal behind the latest
principal-authored input the model has received, that request's included.
The calls a response leads to run under it, so a message that lands after
the request lends nobody's authority to them. The session caches two
answers its steps give, folded in `seq` order with its status: the speaker
of its latest model request, and the untrusted mark. A reader that needs
them now folds the steps after the cache's last `seq` with `fold`.

The mark is set when the first data lands, no later than the model reads
it: the next model request delivers every input that waits, and a tool's
response is read by the request after it. So no tool call is ever decided
on a mark the model's reading has outrun."""
