"""Step storage that seals content on its way in and opens it on its way
out, over another step storage, behind the same interface. Nothing above it
sees a sealed step, and nothing below it sees content in the clear.

A step that says something, its blocks or its children, is sealed under the
current version of its session's key with AES-GCM, bound to the tenant, the
session, the step, and the version, so a sealed blob copied to another step
opens nothing. A step that says nothing, a lifecycle mark or a request that
only references, needs no key and is kept as it is. A read opens each step
with the version it names; a version destroyed reads as absent, and the
step keeps its place, its type, and its header."""
