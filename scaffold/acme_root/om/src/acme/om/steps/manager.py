"""The steps swimlane: the history of every session, append-only, the record
every other part of the engine appends to or reads. It is the source of
truth; a session's status, its context, its trace, and its cost are
queries or projections over it.

Two appends write it. A run's append names the writer epoch the run took
when it began, and is refused once another run has begun. The inbox's
append takes inputs and controls, which arrive whether or not a run holds
the session, and nothing else.

Both write a principal's message in the name of the context that appends
it: its principal is that context's user, never one the caller wrote
(`attribution.rules.said_by`). A person's decision on a tool call is
written the same way, with the role that context holds
(`attribution.rules.decided_by`)."""
