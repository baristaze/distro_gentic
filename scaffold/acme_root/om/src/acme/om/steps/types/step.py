"""A step: the smallest thing the engine records, one event, written once.

A request and its response are two steps; a response points at its request
(`responds_to`), and a request never waits for its response to exist. No
step is two things and none copies another: a `model_request` references
the steps it carried, and a `tool_request` references the tool-use block of
the response that asked for it. A step's fields split into a header, its
shape, which stays readable, and its content, which is sealed at rest.

A step is checked against its type when it is built, so a step that breaks
its type's shape is refused there and never stored: the header its type
fixes, the blocks its type may hold, `responds_to` on a response alone, an
attachment's placeholder for every block that names one, the agent named
in the header of every step an agent produced, a tool request always
among them, and the head and tail of a result kept as an artifact."""
