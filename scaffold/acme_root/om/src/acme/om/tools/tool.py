"""What a tool implements, and the one way it reaches a workspace.

A tool is native code, a server's tool over MCP, or a sub-agent; each is a
`ToolInterface` with a declared `ToolSpec`. A tool reaches the world only
through the `ToolRuntime` its call is given: the workspace's transport,
bound to the call's key, its run's writer epoch, its deadline, and the
secrets its spec declares. It never holds the transport or a workspace of
its own, and never starts a process or opens a file on the engine's host.

An `unsafe` tool runs at most one command a call, so the transport's record
of that command is the call's outcome after a crash. A tool that must do
more in one call does it in one command, or is not unsafe."""
