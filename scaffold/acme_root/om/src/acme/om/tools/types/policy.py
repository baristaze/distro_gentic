"""Policy: one of three decisions for a call, from the call's tool, its
class, its effect, and the attributes of what it targets. Never from what
the model says about the call: nothing here has a field for it.

Three layers decide. The agent kind's defaults first; the tenant's layer
narrows or loosens them; the platform's ceilings cap the result, so no
tenant loosens a call past them. A sub-agent's call is decided under the
defaults of every kind above it as well, and the strictest decision holds.
The tenant's layer is stored, with who may approve each class."""
