"""`write_plan`: the agent writes its plan, the steps it will take and where
it stands. Each call the history answers without a failure is one version
of the plan, kept in the history like any call: the model's own words in
its response, and the plan again in the call's answer, which a person
reads among the session's steps. The current plan is a projection of the
history (`current_plan`), never a second copy, and the loop renders it last
in each request of the main model role."""
