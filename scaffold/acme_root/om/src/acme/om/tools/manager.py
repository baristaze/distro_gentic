"""The tools swimlane: where the engine touches the world. It decides who
must agree to a call, runs it in the session's workspace through the
transport, and answers it with a response the model reads; it decides what
a new run may repeat after a crash, and records a person's decision on a
call. The loop writes the steps; this namespace builds the ones it answers
with, and writes only a person's decision and its own audit entries.

A call's request step is in the history, written and audited, before any
operation here sees it. Its input is the tool use's, and it must hash to
what the request recorded, under the key of its session.

What a call keeps of its session's content goes under that session's key
too: its input's hash is keyed by it, and the transport's record of its
command keeps the output sealed by it. So does a snapshot of its workspace:
sealed by that key, stored under a hash keyed by it, and named in the
history by a step (ADR 1027). A sub-agent forked from it keeps its own
copy, taken by the spawning call (ADR 1030)."""
