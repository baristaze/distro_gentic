    the identity provider, which the tenancy manager signs people in and
    invites them through. None is a process that signs nobody in, and every
    call that would reach the provider is refused as unavailable.

    The options after `integrations` are what the process that sweeps sets
    on the managers it purges through: each one's retention and batch. None
    keeps that manager's defaults.

    `model_prices` is what the resolver asks before it picks a model. None
    asks the one source of prices, the budgets' list table, so a model with
    no row of its own resolves nowhere.

    `models_layer` is a layer's own models: the client each model call runs
    on. None keeps the engine's: every call on the platform's key.

    `call_gate` is the budget gate every model call passes, the loop's and a
    compaction's, and `prompt_hash` the key service's hash a request's
    header records. None wires the budgets' gate behind the one, and the
    privacy namespace's keyed hash behind the other. `budget_gate` None is
    the gate over the ledger; outside `environment` `local`, a quiet null
    gate or ledger is refused at boot (`UnsafeConfiguration`).
    `artifact_seal` is what seals an artifact's text under its session's
    key, `record_seal` what seals a command's output in its transport's
    record, and `snapshot_seal` what seals a workspace's snapshot; None
    wires the privacy namespace's seal over the session keys.
    `compaction_policy` None keeps the default policy.

    Three are the adopter's for its agents: `agent_kinds`, every version of
    each kind it still runs; `principal_context`, the transition of its
    tenancy manager that answers for a principal's live permissions, which
    every tool call asks; and `result_gate`, the gate a result passes. None
    wires the tenancy manager's own, which answers for a person by the
    membership they hold at the call and for no service principal, and the
    null gate, which accepts a result and marks it unverified.

    The loop takes the rest: `tool_catalog`, the adopter's tools, after the
    engine's own (`engine_tools`), of which a session's registry holds those
    its kind names; a tool of the adopter's that takes an engine tool's name
    is refused. `attachment_reader` is what reads an attachment's text for
    the engine's read tool, None the null that refuses. Then
    `domain_classes`, the classes the adopter declares; `stream_sink`, the
    carrier its parts go to, None the quiet null, which drops them; and
    `loop_options`. Its outage signal is infra's, and its model providers
    the integrations'."""
