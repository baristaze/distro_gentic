"""Storage of the budgets swimlane. Every operation takes org_id first.

Two interfaces, one per role. The budgets themselves are the system of
record, in `core`, written with their outbox rows. The ledger is in
`activity`: a hold and its settlement are each written once, and a tally per
line and window counts what open holds reserve and what settlements spent
(ADR 1006). A hold carries the amount of each line as the gate read it, so
the ledger never reads `core`. Beside them, a usage record per billed model
call keeps what the call used and cost, with no content, in every storage
mode (ADR 1014)."""
