"""A budget: a scope, a window, and an amount.

The scope is a key the platform defines (a session, a tree, a person, a
project, a team, a tenant); the engine compares keys and reads nothing into
them. The window is the scope's whole life, an hour, a day, a week, a month,
or a span of whole seconds, each counted in UTC. The amount is reference
cost, native tokens, or both. Each part is a column of its own, so the gate
finds a scope's budgets by its key in the statement."""
