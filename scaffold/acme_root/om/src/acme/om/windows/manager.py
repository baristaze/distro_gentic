"""The windows swimlane: what one model request reads. A session grows
without limit and a model reads a bounded amount; a window is the view
between the two, sized for one model, and rendering it is deterministic so
the same steps give the same bytes.

The main model role's window is the active one, pinned to the right edge
of the history and starting at the latest summary. When it nears its
limit, a principal asks, or a provider refuses its prompt as too long, it
compacts: the summarizer folds the oldest part into a `summary` step, and
the steps themselves never change. A side model role reads a consistent
suffix sized to its own fill. A tool result too large for a step is kept
as an artifact the agent reads a page at a time, sealed under its session's
key like the step it came from, and purged with its history. So is a
child's report too large for a step of its parent's."""
