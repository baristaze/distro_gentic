"""Pure rules of a loop's limits of time, steps, and streaks: what each one
measures, and what it does when it trips. Values in, values out; no clock,
no storage. The budget, a guard too, trips at the gate
(`budgets.rules.budget_park`).

| Limit | Measures | Kind | When it trips |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deadline | one instant the tree shares | guard | parks for a person |
| Step guard | model calls in one loop | guard | parks so a person looks |
| Error streak | consecutive tool errors, identical calls, or identical requests | bound | ends `inconclusive` |
| Nudges | turns that neither continue nor submit | bound | ends `inconclusive` |
| Run time | wall time of one run | yield | hands the loop back to the queue |

A guard parks, a bound ends the loop, a yield hands it to a new run. A bound
is a loop that cannot make progress, which no raised limit cures, so it is
read first: a loop that trips a bound and a guard at once ends. Its outcome
is `inconclusive`, never `failed`, and it never ends the session.

The step guard is on always. It is the one backstop a free model or a
missing price cannot switch off: `Limits` refuses a guard of zero or past
its ceiling, and `tripped` holds a value that went around the check to the
same bounds. Every loop starts it afresh, and a person's look after it
parks starts it again, so it is never a lifetime cap."""
