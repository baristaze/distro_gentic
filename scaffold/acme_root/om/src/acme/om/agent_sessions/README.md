# Agent sessions

Conversations with an agent that never end: a series of loops over one
history. This is one of the kinds of thing [Acme is made of](../../../../README.md).

## What it holds

- **Agent session**: one conversation with an agent: who started it,
  its title, the people it is shared with, its [agent
  kind](../agents/README.md) and the tools it may call, the session that
  spawned it or handed it the work, the root of its tree, and a status it
  keeps up to date from its [steps](../steps/README.md). The steps are
  the truth; the status is kept for listing and finding, and so are the
  person who spoke last and the untrusted mark
  ([attribution](../attribution/README.md)).
- **Loop**: the steps from what woke the session to how the loop ended.
  It is no record of its own: a loop is a span of steps.
- **Status**: `pending` while an input waits for the agent, `running`
  while the agent works, `parked` while a loop waits on something, and
  `idle` when no loop is open.
- **Park**: why a parked loop waits, what clears it, and when it tries
  again by itself. A park only a person clears (a question, a hand-over,
  a pause) has no time to try again.
- **Limits**: what keeps a loop from running forever. A deadline the
  whole tree shares and a step guard, which counts model calls in one
  loop, park it for a person; a streak of tool errors or of identical
  calls, and too many turns that neither go on nor finish, end it
  `inconclusive`; a run that has run long hands its loop to the next run.
- **Archived**: a flag a person sets on an idle session.
- **Deleted**: a mark a person sets on an idle session, which hides it
  and can be undone until its retention ends.

## What can happen

- **Start** a session. It begins idle, with no history.
- **Receive.** A person's message or control lands in the history at
  once, whether or not the agent is working, and the status follows it.
- **Wake.** An input that wakes an idle session makes it pending, and a
  loop begins. Each time a session turns pending, the write that turns
  it asks for a run of its loop, which the session runner takes up.
- **Work.** Once the agent writes a step, the session is running.
- **Park.** A loop that cannot go on yet parks; what clears it makes the
  session pending again, for the agent to take up.
- **Wake by itself.** A park with a time to try again is woken at that
  time from the work queue, and a raised budget wakes every session
  parked on a budget. A woken session is pending; the run that takes it
  up writes a `resumed` step and asks its gates again.
- **End a loop.** The session goes idle, and the next input that wakes
  it starts the next loop over the same history. A waking input the loop
  never delivered keeps it pending, so a new loop starts on it, unless
  the loop ended in an error or a principal cancelled it: then the input
  waits for whatever wakes the session next.
- **Archive.** An archived session keeps what arrives and wakes for
  nothing, until a person's message brings it back.
- **List** the sessions in a status, a page at a time.
- **Delete.** A deleted session is hidden from every read and list. Its
  history and everything about it stay as they were.
- **Restore.** Unmarking a deleted session brings it back as it was,
  with its history.
- **Purge.** Once a deleted session has waited out its retention, thirty
  days by default, the sweep removes it and its history for good. From
  the moment the purge begins, the session can no longer be restored. A
  deleted org's sessions and history go when the org is purged.

## The rules

- **A session never ends.** A loop ends; the session waits for its next
  input.
- **A stopped loop never restarts itself.** A loop that ended in an
  error, or that a principal cancelled, starts no new loop on an input
  it left undelivered (ADR 1009).
- **"Not now" is not "failed".** A park writes no outcome, and a limit
  that no raise cures ends the loop `inconclusive`, never `failed`, and
  never the session.
- **The step guard is never off.** Every loop starts it afresh, and a
  person's look after it parks starts it again.
- **The status follows the steps.** It is read off the history, can be
  rebuilt from it at any time, and is never set by hand.
- **A change of status, and the end of a loop, are announced.** A step
  on its own is not.
- **Two writers never both land.** Each write of a session names the
  version it read.
- **A session takes what it must from where it came.** A sub-agent or
  a handed-over session carries the mark of the session it came from,
  and a sub-agent calls only tools its parent may. Whoever makes it
  cannot choose otherwise.
- **Every session belongs to one org.** Another org's session answers as
  one that never existed, and a session's parent is in its own org.
- **A deleted session answers as one that never existed,** until it is
  restored.
- **Nothing is purged on demand.** Only the sweep purges, and only what
  was deleted longer ago than the retention, or an org deleted longer ago
  than its own.
