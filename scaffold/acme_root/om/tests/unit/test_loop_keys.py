"""The key a call goes out on, over the memory storage and the scripted
provider: the loop asks a layer's call credentials before every call, and
the gate is told which key the call carries. A call whose key cannot be had
parks its session on the provider until a key is saved, with nothing held
and no usage recorded. A key the provider does not take is marked refused,
and no outage is reported for the provider; a permission the key lacks is
the call's alone, and the key stays."""
