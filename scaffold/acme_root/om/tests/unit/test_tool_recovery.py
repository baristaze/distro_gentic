"""A new run settles a request a lost run left open by what its tool's
effect allows. A `read_only` or `idempotent` call runs again under the same
key, the request's id. An `unsafe` one is never repeated: the transport's
record of how its command ended answers it, and with none it is
`interrupted`, its outcome unknown."""
