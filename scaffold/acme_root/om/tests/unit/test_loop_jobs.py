"""A job over the memory storage and the scripted provider: its call parks
the loop on the job, holding nothing; its completion, checked against the
park, wakes the loop, which answers the call from it before any model call;
a completion that never comes ends at the job's deadline, never past the
tree's; cancelling the loop, or any other end of it, cancels the job; a
completion that names another session's job, or one settled already, is
refused and wakes nothing; a job that spends passes the budget gate
before it starts, and its hold is released only when its start was refused
before any work began; a run lost after it wrote a job's request is
recovered by one start under one hold, parked on that job, and a budget
that refuses the recovered call parks the loop on the gate's one answer;
the lost run's calls after that job are settled by their effect before
the loop parks on it, and a cancel met there cancels the job too; and a
completion that reports more than any job costs is refused as
invalid input."""
