"""A session in line for a leased resource, over the memory storage and the
scripted provider: a tool's ask answers at once with its place, and when
the turn ends while it waits, the loop parks on `resource` naming its
place, and makes no model call until the grant, which reaches the model as
the engine's notice with the lease and its token; a grant that lands after
the ask was read and before the park wakes it all the same; a session
cancelled in line leaves it, and the next request is granted; a lease
revoked after its loop ended is told in the next loop, and one that ended
before its session resumed is told as ended, never as granted; a turn
that ends past the tree's deadline parks on it and holds no line;
a session granted past it parks on it and gives the lease back, told
once; and what an ask's standing owes the model is told once, a grant
its call answered with never."""
