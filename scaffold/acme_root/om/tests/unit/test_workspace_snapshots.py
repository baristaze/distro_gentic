"""A workspace's snapshot, over the memory storage, the local buckets, and the
twin provider (ADR 1027, ADR 1030). A snapshot is kept sealed under its session's key,
under a hash keyed by it, and a step names it. A restore trusts its bytes
only by that hash, and one that does not match loses the workspace before
it starts. A snapshot holds no credential and no injected secret's value.
The loop snapshots a workspace kept by snapshots at the end of each run, and
the next run starts from it. A rewind starts the next loop from an earlier
snapshot, a step records it, and every earlier step and snapshot stays; one
that cannot load parks once, and a person's unlock goes on without it. A
fork takes its parent's workspace as it stands at the spawn, in any run,
and the child starts from a copy of its own; a fork whose snapshot is
refused spends nothing of the tree."""
