"""A job's call in line for a leased resource, over the memory storage and
the scripted provider: a job tool whose work runs on a held resource asks
in line, and its loop parks on `resource` at once, naming its place and
the job; the grant starts the job in its own commit, the park moves to
the job's, and the job's result answers the call, with no model call and
no notice between the ask and the answer; a free resource's grant starts
the job at once; a grant between the read and the park still reaches the
session; a session cancelled while its job waits in line leaves the
line, so no job starts; and once the grant started the job, a session
cancelled or a job stopped at its deadline hands the tool's cancel the
request, which ends the lease."""
