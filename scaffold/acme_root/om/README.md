# What Acme is made of

This page names the things Acme is made of and says how they relate.
It is written for anyone; you need no code to read it. Each kind of
thing has a page of its own one level down, which says what can happen
to it and which rules always hold. A product built on Acme adds its own
kinds beside these.

## The org and the people in it

An **organization**, org for short, is one tenant: a company, a team, a
household. Everything in Acme belongs to exactly one org, and nothing
in one org can see anything in another. That is a rule, not a choice.

Every person has one **personal org**, made with them the first time
they sign in. It is theirs for as long as they exist, and it goes only
with their account. Every other org is a **team org**, which a person
makes and owns.

An **identity** is one person across every org: the email the sign-in
provider has verified. Acme keeps no password.

A **user** is that person inside one org: the name the org sees.

A **membership** is the user's place in the org, with a role: viewer,
member, admin, or owner. The role decides what the person may do there.

An **invitation** asks a person to join an org, by email, with a role.
The sign-in provider sends the email.

## How a person proves who they are

A **session** is a signed-in visit to one org. It ends when the person
signs out, when it sits idle too long, or when it reaches its lifetime.

An **API key** is a named, expiring credential for a program, with a
role no higher than its maker's. Acme keeps only its fingerprint, so
the key is shown once.

A **socket ticket** is a one-use pass that opens the live channel, the
connection through which changes reach a screen as they happen.

An **operator** is a person on the platform's own allowlist. An
operator works across orgs with an **operator token**: one permission,
an hour at most.

## Files

A **file** is a record of something an org keeps in the object store:
its name, type, size, who uploaded it, and why. The bytes live in the
store, never in the record.

## Agent sessions and their history

An **agent session** is a conversation with an agent. It never ends: it
is a series of **loops**, each running from what woke the session to how
the loop ended, over one history. Its status says whether an input waits,
the agent works, a loop waits on something, or nothing is open.

A **step** is one event of a session's history: a message, a control, a
model's request or response, a tool's request or response, a summary, or
a mark of a loop's life. Steps are numbered with no gaps and written
once; the history only grows, until its purge.

A session marked **deleted** is hidden and can be restored. Once it has
waited out its retention, the sweep **purges** it with its history, the
one delete a history has, under a database login no serving process
holds.

What a step says is its **content**, and it is **sealed**: kept only
under a **session key** of its own session, which the platform holds
locked by the org's key. Everything else about a step, its **shape**,
stays readable. **Revoking** a session's key erases its content and
keeps its shape, so the history keeps its holes in known places. A
session may instead keep its content in **memory only**.

An **agent kind** is what kind of agent a session runs: the tools it may
call, when its work is done, and how its calls are allowed. A session
may start **sub-agents**, sessions of their own below it; together they
form a **tree** that shares one budget and one deadline. A session may
also **hand off** work to another kind, as a new session.

Every step says who produced it. A message and a tool call say on whose
**authority** they run, and a call to a model says who **pays** for it:
a person of the org, never the agent. A session that has read outside
data carries an **untrusted mark**, and passes it on.

## Budgets

A **budget** says how much may be spent, in money at list price, in
tokens, or both, by a session, a tree of sessions, a person, a project,
a team, or the whole org, over its life or per hour, day, week, or
month.

Before every call to a model, an agent asks the **gate**. The gate
either sets aside the most the call could cost, a **hold**, or refuses
and says which budgets are in the way and when each resets. A refused
loop waits, never fails, until the budget is raised or resets. After
the call, the hold is settled at what the call really cost.

## Models

A **model role** is a job an agent session hands a model: the agent's
own turns, or a summary. A **fill** is the model that does it, and how. A
session's **fill set** holds its fills, one per model role; a **switch**
gives it a new version, and the session's history records each one.

## What a model reads

A **window** is the part of a session's history one call of a model
reads, sized for that model. When the agent's own window nears its limit,
its oldest part is folded into a **summary**, a step of its own, and the
**pinned zone** carries the session's objective and its principals'
standing instructions through every fold. A tool's result too large for
a step is kept whole as an **artifact** in the object store.

## The loop

The **loop** is what an agent does, whatever its kind: it asks a model
what to do next, does it, and records each step before it acts. It runs
until the kind's work is done, a limit stops it, a person cancels it, or
it must wait. A person can write to it while it runs, pause it, cancel
it, or take over its workspace by hand. What it is writing streams live
to whoever watches.

## Tools and who agrees to them

A **tool** is one thing an agent can do, such as run a command or push a
branch, with the kind of power it uses and whether doing it twice is
harmless. An agent can do only what its kind's tools allow.

A **tool policy** is an org's say over its agents' tools: which calls run
on their own, which wait for a person, and which never run, and who may
approve each kind. A person's yes or no to one call is a step of the
session's history.

## What the platform writes for itself

No person creates these and no screen shows them, but each belongs to
an org like everything else.

An **event** is a line in the org's diary: what changed, how, by whom,
and when. The lines are numbered with no gaps. An **audit entry** is an
event the platform records about itself, such as a job that failed for
good.

An **outbox row** is a note written in the same stroke as a change,
saying "tell everyone about this". The event and the live push come
from it, so no change goes unannounced.

A **work item** is a job for later. It waits in a queue until a worker
claims it, holds it for a short lease, and does it.

An **orchestration** is a long job kept as a record, done one step at a
time. It succeeds, fails, or parks until what it waits for is back.

An **idempotency record** remembers the outcome of a request that may
arrive twice, so the second copy gets the first one's answer.

## How they fit together

- An org has users. A user is one identity's place in the org, held by
  a membership with a role.
- A session or an API key belongs to a user, so everything done with
  it is done as that user in that org.
- Every change a screen acts on writes an outbox row, which becomes an
  event in the org's diary, which reaches every open screen of the org.
- A work item, an orchestration, an idempotency record, an event, and
  an outbox row each name their org, so the fence between orgs holds
  for them too.
- An agent session's fill set names the model for each of its jobs, and
  each switch of it is a step of the session's history.
- A window and its summaries read a session's steps and change none of
  them; an artifact belongs to the session whose step names it.
- An agent session's steps are its truth. Its status is read off them,
  and a change of it writes an outbox row like any other change. A
  session and its steps name their org.
- A sub-agent holds no more than the session above it: fewer tools or
  the same, the same person's authority, and the same budget and
  deadline as the whole tree. A tree names its org, as its sessions do.
- A step's content is sealed under its session's key, so revoking one
  key erases what one session said and nothing else.
- Every model call passes the gate first, charged to the scopes it
  serves: its session, its tree, the person who pays, a project, a team,
  or the org. A budget, its holds, and their settlements name their org.
- A tool policy names its org, one each, and a person's decision on a
  call lands in the session's history like any other step.
- A loop is a run of a session's steps and has no record of its own; it
  reads where it is from them, so a loop a crash interrupted goes on
  where it stopped.
