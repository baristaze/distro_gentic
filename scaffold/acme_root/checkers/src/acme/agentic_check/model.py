"""The values every part of agentic-check shares: a rule, a violation, a finding.

A rule is a function over a `Project` that yields `Violation`s. Its
registration (`acme.agentic_check.registry.rule`) carries what the lens says
about it: the id, the group, the severity, and how much of the lens the
rule decides. The runner turns each violation into a `Finding` stamped
with those fields, so a rule never repeats them.
