"""Workspaces: the place an agent works, a capability, not a domain. A
provider prepares, releases, and purges a workspace to an isolation spec: a
mode, an egress policy, and resource limits. The transport runs commands
there (`acme.infra.transports`).

Isolation is chosen up front and never weakened. A provider meets a spec
whole or refuses it with `IsolationRefused`, before it creates anything, and
never hands back a weaker place in its stead. A released workspace keeps its
files and loses its instance: the next prepare under the same id finds the
files again. A purged one keeps nothing.

A workspace is a cache. A provider that can also snapshots one: everything
its commands could write, as one archive its own `prepare` starts a
workspace from. A spec that asks for a workspace that can be kept so
(`Durability.SNAPSHOT`) is refused by a provider that cannot, before
anything is made, and is never met by a cache in its stead. A snapshot too
large to pass as bytes, such as a VM's disk, stays in the provider's own
store, and its archive names it by a reference and a digest (ADR 1029).

A spec may name a base: an image, and the commands that set it up, run once
with the setup's own egress. A base with setup is a snapshot of a workspace
its setup ran in, so only a provider that snapshots can serve one. A
workspace on it starts from that snapshot and runs with its spec's egress,
never the setup's.

What a workspace is rebuilt from may be gone for good, such as the branch a
checkout tracks. A layer that prepares one then raises `WorkspaceLost`, and
the loop parks, loudly, for a person."""
