"""Workspaces: the place an agent works, a capability, not a domain. A
provider prepares, releases, and purges a workspace to an isolation spec: a
mode, an egress policy, and resource limits. The transport runs commands
there (`acme.infra.transports`).

Isolation is chosen up front and never weakened. A provider meets a spec
whole or refuses it with `IsolationRefused`, before it creates anything, and
never hands back a weaker place in its stead. A released workspace keeps its
files and loses its instance: the next prepare under the same id finds the
files again. A purged one keeps nothing."""
