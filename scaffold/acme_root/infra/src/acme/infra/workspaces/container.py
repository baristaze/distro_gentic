    """A container per workspace on the local Docker, with its files in a
    volume of its own that outlives the container. It meets the container
    mode with no egress or open egress, and every resource limit. A running
    container is reused only under the spec it was started to; under any
    other, a tightened one included, it is replaced and its files kept. An
    allowlist needs an egress proxy this provider does not run, so it is
    refused; so is every spec when Docker cannot be reached. There is no
    weaker place to fall back to.

    A workspace's container drops every capability, takes no new
    privileges, and keeps nothing of the engine's environment: its
    variables are the image's. With no egress it has no network; with open
    egress it joins `OPEN_NETWORK`, where no container reaches another.
    What the host itself answers on the bridge, its metadata service
    included, is the host's to close (ADR 1017). Its hostname is its name,
    the same for every container the workspace runs in.

    A snapshot holds the container's whole filesystem: its writable layer,
    as `docker diff` names what changed in it, and its volume, with the
    paths removed from the image. It names the image beneath by its id and
    by the digest a registry serves it under, when it has one. It is taken
    with the container paused, so nothing writes while it is. A restore
    starts a container on that image, pulled by its digest on a host that
    lacks it, and copies both back, owners and modes kept (ADR 1027).

    A base is the image it names, or, with setup, a snapshot of a container
    its setup ran in. Each container on it starts on the image that
    snapshot names, with the setup's layer copied in; its files are copied
    into the volume only when the volume is new, so a workspace found again
    keeps its own (ADR 1028). A setup is given open egress or none, as a
    workspace is. Its container holds the runtime's default capabilities
    less raw sockets, so a package manager can change owners and drop to
    its own user; it takes no new privileges and is never privileged."""
