"""A directory on this host whose commands run as an account of their own
(ADR 1021).

A directory confines where files go and nothing else. An account confines
what a command reaches of the host: each command runs as a named account,
with its group, no supplementary group, every capability dropped from
every set, and no way to gain one back (`setpriv`), under the limits the
mode enforces (`prlimit`), in a session of its own. It reaches what the
account may, and nothing of this process's: not its files, its credential,
or its environment. No program that runs with this process's privileges
sees the command's environment: it reaches the command after the switch.

What a command left holding its output once its own process has exited
is ended as the account, which reaches the account's processes alone
(ADR 1023). The account serves one workspace at a time, so every process
of the account is that workspace's. A release ends each of them, as the
account, whatever `/proc` hides from this process, then each one in its
directory, and closes the workspace to the account, so the next
workspace's commands never reach its files. A purge clears what the account wrote, as the
account, then removes the directory without following a link out of it.

It runs under a hardened unit, which hides `/proc/sys` (`ProcSubset=pid`)
and refuses a setuid or setgid bit (`RestrictSUIDSGID=yes`): the host's
setting it needs is declared where it cannot be read, and a workspace is
shared with the account's group by a default ACL, never by a setgid bit.

What stays a product's: which account its host gives its agents, the
grants it adds to that account, and how its host image makes it."""
