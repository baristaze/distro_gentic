"""The key service: a capability that holds each tenant's wrapping key and
makes, unwraps, and re-wraps data keys under it. It never keeps a data key.
A data key leaves `generate` twice: in the clear, for the caller to use and
drop, and wrapped, for the caller to keep. Only the service unwraps it
again.

A data key is named by the tenant, the key it belongs to (a session's id),
and its version. A wrapped key is bound to that name: one presented under
another tenant, another key, or another version is refused, so a copy moved
to another session opens nothing. Destroying a data key is destroying every
wrapped copy of it, which is the keeper's to do: a key service holds no copy
to destroy.

A tenant's wrapping key has versions of its own. A key wrapped under an
older one still unwraps; `rewrap` moves it to the current one without the
data key ever leaving the service, so a rotation touches no data sealed
under it."""
