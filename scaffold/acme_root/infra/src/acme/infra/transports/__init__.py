"""Transports: the one way a command runs in a workspace, and a file there is
read, written, or listed, wherever the workspace is: a directory on this
host, a container, or a twin. Every tool that runs a command or touches a
file goes through a transport, and none reaches past it.

A command carries three things from the run that sends it. Its key, the id
of its tool request, under which the transport records how it ended, so a
new run can ask after a crash. Its writer epoch, which the transport fences
on its own side: a command from a run that lost its claim is refused
(`StaleCommand`). And its deadline, when the command's whole process tree
ends, children and all.

The record keeps what recovery decides by in the clear: the exit, whether
the command timed out or was cut, and the secrets it used, by name. Its
output is content, so it is kept sealed under the key of the session the
command runs for, by the seal the engine hands over with the command
(`RecordSeal`); the transport never holds that key. A workspace's records
go when its session is purged (`purge_records`).

A secret reaches a command by name, never by value (ADR 1003). A brokered
one is attached outside the workspace by the credential broker, per
destination, and the process never holds it. Only when a secret must enter
the process is it injected: resolved for this one command by the transport,
into an environment built from nothing, so no credential of the engine's
reaches it, and redacted from everything the command prints, raw, encoded,
or escaped, before anything streams or returns. The value is dropped when
the command ends; the result names each secret it used, never a value."""
