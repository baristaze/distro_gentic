"""A process a transport starts on this host, driven to its end: its output
pumped through the command's redaction as it arrives, kept within a bound
(past it, its head and its tail, where a command's end, its summary or the
error that stopped it, usually is), and its whole tree ended at the
deadline.

A command is over when its own process exits. Its output is read on for a
short bound (`DRAIN_SECONDS`), and what still holds it then is ended: every
process of its group, and every one descended from one. Its own pid may name
another process by then; its group cannot while a process of it lives. So a
process a command left holding its output never holds the command to its
deadline.

A tree is the process, every process descended from it, and its process
group. Ending it freezes what is below the process first, walking the tree
again after each freeze, so a process that forks while it is being ended is
caught, then kills every process found and the group. A process that both
leaves the group and is orphaned before the walk escapes both; the
workspace's release is what ends it."""
