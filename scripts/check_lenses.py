"""Check that every lens file follows the format in lenses/README.md and cites a real section of the spec.

A lens holds the checkable detail under a rule `distro_gentic_spec.md`
states. It is stricter than the spec, never contrary to it. This check
holds its format, its citations, and the names it quotes; that it stays
inside its rule is held by review.

Rules:
- every group listed in lenses/README.md has a file, and every file is listed;
  each group lists its own prefix, and no two groups share one;
- lens headings are `## <PREFIX>-NN Title`, with the prefix the group lists,
  numbered 01.. in order;
- every lens has Principle, Source, Look for, Violation, Severity, an
  optional Shape, and Check, in that order;
- Source names sections of the spec by title, never by number: `<Section>`
  or `<Section>, <Subsection>`, several separated by `;`, where a bare
  `<Subsection>` after a `;` belongs to the section cited before it. A
  title may hold commas of its own (`Work In, Results Out`), so a
  citation is read as a whole section first, then as each split at `, `
  into a section and one of its subsections. A citation of a subsection
  may end in `(<Label>, <Label>)`, and each label is a bold paragraph
  label `**<Label>.**` inside that subsection; a citation of a whole
  section takes no parentheses;
- Severity is high, medium, or low;
- a Principle is at most 120 words, and Look for and Violation are at most
  three sentences each, so a lens stays one rule a reviewer can hold;
- a field value runs to the next field or lens heading, wrapped lines
  and list items included; fenced code is neither a lens nor a field,
  so a lens file can show lens syntax in an example;
- no line of a lens file is wider than 80 columns;
- a lens count stated in README.md or lenses/README.md ("N lenses") equals
  the size of the catalog;
- an optional Shape field, after Severity, names one or two files or
  folders of the scaffold that show the rule, each a path in backticks
  that starts `scaffold/acme_root/` and exists, separated by a comma or
  `and`;
- the Check field reads `review` when the review alone judges the lens,
  "`distro-check` decides it." when the checker decides it whole, or
  "`distro-check` decides <part>; the rest is judged." when it decides a
  part. It agrees both ways with the rules the scaffold's checker
  registers, in `scaffold/acme_root/checkers/src/acme/distro_check/rules/`:
  a lens that names the checker has a rule of its id with the same
  coverage (`full` or `partial`), and every rule decides a lens that
  names it. The rules are read with `ast`, never imported;
- an identifier a lens quotes stays in the section it cites. A section is
  the text under its `##` heading, its subsections, code, and agents-only
  blocks (`<!-- agents-only ... -->`) included, and no other HTML comment.
  An identifier is a backticked name written as code: it holds an
  underscore, a lower-case letter before a capital, a dot, or a closing
  `()` (`responds_to`, `AgentSession`, `ctx.deadline`, `is_input()`); a
  file name is not one. Every identifier in a Principle is held to the
  cited sections, because the Principle restates them. An identifier in
  Look for or Violation is held to them when the spec names it anywhere;
  one it never names is the lens's own example of a breach;
- a tag is one of `core`, `default`, `optional`, and `style`, in inline
  code, alone on the first line under a `##` or `###` heading. A lone
  backticked word there that is none of the four is refused. A tag covers
  its own heading's text, not the headings below it;
- a lens whose every citation names a section or subsection tagged
  `style` is `low`: a house convention's breach is a low finding at most.

Exit status is non-zero when any rule fails. Standard library only.
