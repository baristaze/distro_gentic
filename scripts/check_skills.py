"""Check every skill under skills/ and the scaffold's skills for a uniform shape.

A folder that does not exist holds no skill, and passes. Rules:
- every skills/<name>/SKILL.md has YAML frontmatter with `name` equal to the
  folder name, `distro-` then lowercase words joined by one hyphen each,
  so it never collides with the guideline's `arch-*` or the engine's
  `agentic-*`, and a non-empty `description` of at most 500 characters,
  written as one double-quoted string; the descriptions together stay
  under 6000 characters. Each description is listed in a budget the
  host shares across every installed skill. The host truncates one entry
  at 1,536 characters, and when the listing overflows it drops the
  descriptions of the least-used skills. So this plugin keeps its share
  small;
- the frontmatter holds only the fields of the Agent Skills standard
  (https://agentskills.io/specification: `name`, `description`,
  `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools`), plus
  `disable-model-invocation`, Claude Code's key, which VS Code, Cursor,
  and Factory also read: a person starts the skill by name, and the
  model never does. The standard's validator refuses that key, so only a
  skill that must never start on its own carries it. Any other key is an
  error: a misspelled key, `allowed_tools` for one, would otherwise be a
  skill that silently runs with no tool limits. A `compatibility` holds
  at most 500 characters, as the standard says;
- a skill that says `disable-model-invocation: true` carries Codex's
  switch too, `agents/openai.yaml` in its folder with
  `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`, and a skill whose
  `agents/openai.yaml` turns implicit invocation off says the key: in
  both agents a person starts it, never the model;
- a skill names its own files by a path from its own folder, as the
  standard says, and never through a substitution one agent makes
  (`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`):
  an agent without it reads a wrong path. Nor does a skill or an agent
  file name its arguments as `$ARGUMENTS`, for the same reason. A path
  from the folder is one that climbs out of it (`../`) or one under its
  `references/`; every such path in a skill's Markdown resolves to a
  file or directory that exists inside this repository. A plugin skill
  that names a path climbing out of the folder (`../`) says to read it
  as `realpath` resolves the folder: a skill linked into a project is
  read through the link, and an agent that shortens `../` from the
  link's own path reads a file that is not there;
- allowed-tools is comma-separated, each entry `Name` or `Name(rule)`, with no
  space outside the parentheses (a space inside, `Bash(make check)`, is
  part of the rule); a bare
  `Bash` is refused, as is a rule with a trailing space inside the
  parentheses or the `Bash(cmd *)` spelling; a Bash rule is the
  `Bash(cmd:*)` prefix form, with no other `*`, or an exact
  `Bash(make <target>)`, and anything else (`Bash(*)`, `Bash(curl*)`, an
  exact command that is not make) is refused, as is a rule with a shell
  operator (`;`, `&`, `|`, a redirect, a substitution, a quote) that would
  chain a second command; a make entry names a target, so `Bash(make:*)`
  and `Bash(make -C dir:*)` are refused;
- every skill, the scaffold's included, has a non-empty allowed-tools:
  a skill without one runs with every tool the session has;
- there is exactly one `distro-review-<group>` skill per lens group the
  table of `lenses/README.md` lists, and none for a group it does not
  list; each names its lens file, `lenses/<group>.md`, and
  `distro-review-full` exists and names every group's review skill, so
  a group added to the table cannot go unreviewed. `make gen-skills`
  writes the group skills from one template; `make gen-skills-check`
  holds them to it;
- a review skill (`distro-review-*`) runs no file of the repository it
  reviews: every Bash entry of its allowed-tools is a git command, so
  none pre-approves an interpreter or a runner;
- allowed-tools names only what the body runs; the checker holds the make
  targets to it: for every `Bash(make <target>)` or `Bash(make <target>:*)`,
  `make <target>`, as whole words, appears inside a backticked span of the
  skill body, fenced code left out. Git, uv, and pnpm entries are checked
  by hand;
- frontmatter is flat `key: value` lines, one per key, no key repeated,
  and a space follows each key's colon (`name:foo` is one string to YAML);
- a double-quoted value is one complete YAML double-quoted scalar: it
  closes, its inner quotes are escaped, its escapes are ones YAML defines,
  and nothing but a comment follows the closing quote;
- an unquoted value contains no ": " or " #", and does not start with a
  YAML indicator character, so strict YAML loaders accept it;
- every skill of the scaffold, `scaffold/acme_root/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`,
  which a render of the scaffold runs as a real skill, has the frontmatter
  a skill has: only the standard's keys and `disable-model-invocation`, a
  name that is its folder's and the standard's (lowercase words joined by
  one hyphen each, at most 64 characters), a description of at most 1024
  characters in one double-quoted string, and allowed-tools entries each a
  Name or a `Bash(cmd:*)` prefix, comma-separated. Every path it names
  from its folder resolves inside `scaffold/acme_root/`, the tree a render
  carries. `.agents/skills/` is the folder every agent that reads the
  standard shares, and `scaffold/acme_root/.claude/skills` is a link to
  it, `../.agents/skills`, for Claude Code, which reads only its own.

Exit status is non-zero on any failure. Standard library only.
