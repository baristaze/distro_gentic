"""Generate the Contents of distro_gentic_spec.md from its headings.

The Contents is the list under the `## Contents` heading, up to the next
heading: one entry per section (`##`) that follows it, in order, each a
link to the heading's anchor. The sections above it are the preface a
reader meets first, so the list leaves them out. Headings inside fenced
code or an HTML comment, an agents-only block among them, are ignored: a
rendered page shows neither. Anchors come from `scripts/_common.py`, the
same rule `check_links.py` resolves them with, so every link the list
emits is one that checker accepts, a repeated heading included.

`--check` exits non-zero when the list on disk differs from what the
headings produce, and never writes. Any other argument is refused with
exit status 2, so a mistyped flag cannot fall through to a write.
Standard library only.
