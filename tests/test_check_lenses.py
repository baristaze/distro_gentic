## Steps

`core`

A response points at its request with `responds_to`.

### One Event, One Step

**Pairs.** A request and its response are two steps.

## Loops, Runs, and Sessions

### Durable by Default

`core`

A run takes a writer epoch before it reads the history.

<!-- agents-only
The epoch is installed by `compare_and_set` on the cursor row.
-->

<!-- a note for the editor: `hidden_name` -->

## Bounds and Budgets

### One Gate, Before the Call

Every model call passes one gate.

### Conventions

`style`

A gate is named for what it guards.

## STP-01 A response points at its request

**Principle.** A response points at its request with `responds_to`.

**Source.** Steps, One Event, One Step.

**Look for.** Every response step.

**Violation.** A response with no pointer.

**Severity.** medium

**Check.** review

## STP-02 A stale writer is refused

**Principle.** A run takes a writer epoch before it reads the history.

**Source.** Loops, Runs, and Sessions, Durable by Default; Bounds and
Budgets, One Gate, Before the Call.

**Look for.** Where a run takes its epoch.

**Violation.** An append that ignores the epoch.

**Severity.** high

**Check.** review
